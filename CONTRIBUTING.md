# Contributing to CiCL

[CiCL](https://www.comanlab.com/) is officially run by group of researchers from Princeton University. We welcome contributions to our public projects from the wider open source community.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

## [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/comanlab/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

CiCL has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect our community members to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://github.com/comanlab/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what behaviors will and will not be tolerated.

## Our development process

Start Your Lab uses [GitHub](https://github.com/startyourlab) repositories as its sources of truth. The active team will be working directly there. All repository changes will be, and have been, public from the beginning.

### Reporting new issues

When opening a new issue in one of our repositories, always make sure to fill out the issue template. **This step is very important!** Not doing so may result in your issue not being managed in a timely fashion by a member of CiCL. If this happens, don't take it personally, and feel free to open a new issue once you've gathered all the information required by the template.

- **One bug, one issue:** Please report a single bug per issue.
- **Provide reproduction steps:** List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.

### Reporting bugs

We use GitHub Issues for tracking, discussing, and fixing our site's bugs. If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. If you a are certain this is a new, unreported bug, you can submit a [bug report](#reporting-new-issues).

If you have questions, contact [CiCL](comanlab+github@gmail.com), and we will do our best to answer your questions.

You can also file issues as [feature requests or enhancements](https://github.com/startyourlab/website/labels/feature). If you see anything you'd like to be implemented, create an issue with the [feature request template](https://github.com/startyourlab/website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature%2C+needs+triage&template=feature_request.md)
