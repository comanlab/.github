## üß† Our approach to psychological science

We investigate how cognition manifests in, and is influenced by, the social
contexts in which it occurs. Using a social-interactionist approach, we
investigate how processes carried out by the cognitive system impact outcomes
that characterize communities of individuals: from small groups to larger
social networks. We have focused on understanding the formation of collective
memories, the dynamics of collective beliefs, and the synchronization of
collective emotions as psychologically grounded, interactively constructed, and
dynamic phenomena. Our new directions take advantage of advanced technologies
and complex datasets to study moral tipping points in social networks and
socially constructed value in blockchain systems.
